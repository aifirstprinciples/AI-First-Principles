**Build for Incremental Obsolescence**  
Big-bang rewrites are catastrophically risky. Incremental replacement validates each change before risking the next. Build systems where pieces can be swapped independently.

**Optionality Through Isolation**
Complete system rewrites concentrate all risk into a single deployment.  Smart segmentation isolates components, abstracts their function, then replaces pieces iteratively. Each replacement validates understanding before risking the next. Build replaceable components.

**Build for Incremental Obsolescence **
People naturally want to rebuild legacy systems from scratch rather than break them into replaceable components. Systems built without optionality force catastrophic change when assumptions break. Enable piece-by-piece evolution, not all-or-nothing replacement.

**Lean into Composibility**
People naturally want to rebuild broken systems from scratch rather than improve them incrementally. By creating systems that are composable in nature, pieces can be replaced as-needed and the infrastructure for AI is always adapting.

**Earn the Right to Rebuild**
People naturally want to rebuild broken systems from scratch rather than improve them incrementally. Total rebuilds without earned understanding create elegant solutions to misunderstood problems. <u>*Prove systems can be improved before attempting to replace them entirely.*</u>
